📦 Radio Addon Description
=========================
This addon adds an interactive radio 🎶 object in Garry’s Mod, allowing players to select stations 📻, adjust volume 🔊, and see the current status via a light indicator 💡.
Players can interact with the radio through a built-in menu 🖥️ to change stations and control volume dynamically. The radio volume also adapts automatically based on distance from the player 🚶.
